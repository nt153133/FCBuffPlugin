FCBuffPlugin

RebornBuddy plugin to add Lisbeth hooks to activate and buy FC Actions. 

-Place in RB's Plugins Folder.
-Go to the plugins tab and find "FC Buffs" and click Settings.
-Set the 2 buffs you want and select your FC's Grandcompany so it knows where to buy the actions.

Few Notes:

It will not check rank for the player or FC to know if it has the ability to activate or buy actions. It also won't check FC credits to know if you can afford the action. So only enable the plugin if you can assume those will be fine.

It won't deactivate buffs if they are different than selected but once one or both run out of time it will activate your selected buffs and if you don't have any it'll go to the OIC officer to buy what it needs.
